This project is a mini-capstone project for Software Engineering students at Concordia University. 

**Project Goal:** Clone a repository of a public open-source app, understand the app's codebase and add some simple features. 

**Project Purpose:** Learn how to work with large-scale codebases, learn how to work as a group, and practise the various aspects of software engineering (coding, testing, documentation, etc).

The app assigned to our group is **K-9 Mail**. K-9 Mail is an Android app that can collect e-mails from multiple e-mail accounts (Hotmail, GMail, etc) and present all those e-mails in a single application.
